# Software Specification Project

The development of large information systems is a complex process and demands several layers of abstraction. One first step is the specification of the problem in a rigorous way. After a rigorous specification of the problem, one may perform formal analysis and prove correctness or, in case the specification is not correct, to unveil faults that would be hard to detect by other means.
The second project of the Software Specification course consists on the specification and verification of a fragment of a system called TheatreBooking that
models an application for reserving theatre tickets.
The main objective of this project is to encourage the practice of specification of problems in a rigorous way using Alloy, and then to perform verification of
the developed model. The second aim is to give some experience in usage of automatic verification tools, namely the Alloy language.
